/* This is a C program designed to be a cube root approximator for all purposes.
 * Note that this program cannot determine a exact cube root and please use the 
 * exact cube root calculator for those purposes. This program uses the exact 
 * same principle of approximating the distance to perfect cubes on a numberline
 * to determine the fractional proportion as the square root calculator earlier,
 * and this program runs on the same kind of algorithm derived from that logic.
 * 
 * Note that due to its algorithm's nature, this program also has higher margins
 * than the square root program, and may lead to erronous results,it is strongly
 * advised for smaller values to back up this approximation with an actual calculation
 * from a precise cube root calculator for better results, especially for values 
 * below 100. For negative numbers and 0, the program just returns the value that
 * you inputted, and mixed number inputs return the approx cube root of a randomly
 * generated number or just -inf.
 *
 * Don't even try to copy and paste it >:(
