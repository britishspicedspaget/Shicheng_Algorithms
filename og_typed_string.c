/*
 * Leetcode 3330: Find the original typed string I
 *
 * This is a solution to Leetcode question number 3330, to find the original 
 * typed string I. THe aim of the program is to find the number of original
 * strings possible should it be revealed that one key was pressed consecutively
 * for potentially multiple times. Only one key can be pressed multiple times,
 * so all iterations will occur on one element at eah particular rotation. It uses 
 * the number of times each letter occurs within the string, coupled with special 
 * logic handling for single letter strings and occurences of singular times for 
 * letters to determine the number of iterations each letter can add to the string
 * permutation.
 *
 * Please reference this program should you utilise it in your own code.
