/*This is a C program designed to determine the exact square root 
# of a number to a margin of 0.000001 at least, this program, unlike
# the approximation program, uses a brute force method which gives 
# better results, However, please note that the numbers between 331
# to 349 have a bug in the system that cannot be resolved, and thus
# the preciseness has been lowered for those numbers so as not to 
# trigger a seg fault when the program is run. The program is inte-
# nded for numbers below 1 million, however, it can run with numbers
# above 1 million, but also with lowered accuracy so as not to seg 
# fault the system. Both special cases have a higher margin of error
# to within 0.001 in most tested cases, with some other numbers
# also giving higher margins as well. If you find a number with
# a margin higher than 0.01, please send the number to me so the pr-
# ogram/bug can be corrected. Float inputs will be auto rounded to the 
# lower whole number when calculating OR in some cases trigger a seg
# fault.
#
# Some numbers' square roots are exactly equal to those on calculators
# <:).
#
# Please do not copy paste into your own programs and please give cr-
# eidt if you must for any reason >:(
